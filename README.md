Project Title: World Population Analysis (1950 - 2023)

Research Question:
How does population growth rates vary across continents, and what factors influence these trends?

Hypothesis:
Population growth rates differ significantly across continents, and Male and Female populations are significantly different.

Datasets:
4 data sources: Male Population, Female Population, Continents, Births and Deaths Projected to 2100
Most important columns: Year, Country, Continent, Male Population, Female Population, Total Population.

Key libraries:
Numpy
Pands
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Sklearn
Data lifecycle steps: 
Data Sources – Data Cleaning and Processing – Data Exploration and Analysis – Predictive Machine Learning

Result
Over the period 1950 – 2023, the world population grew from about 2.5 billion to close to 8.1 billion, i.e. more than 300% growth in 73 years
Consistently Asian countries tend to have largest populations, while North and South America have experienced moderate population growth
European countries tend to have lower population growth
However, there is a higher growth trend in African countries, which is set to continue
There are no strong direct correlations between factors such as Population sizes, Birth Estimates, Death Estimates and Gender Ratio, taken in isolation, on Population Growth Rates
There are no significant differences in Male and Female population.
